Global revolutions and power struggles are the focal point as we begin the year discussing early modern imperialism.Students then study the Haitian Revolution, the struggle to implement fair and permanent government thereafter, and the Haitian immigrant experience of the modern day.   In the study of each region and major revolution, we contemplate the influences of geography and cultural exchanges, and attempt to identify challenges or obstacles to stabilizing post-revolutionary societies</p>

While exploring revolutions is inherently interesting, our focus centers on the process of careful historical study: thinking analytically by crafting questions and searching for evidence, and then corroborating that evidence with a number of sources. </p>

                <p> &ldquo;Looking back on the history of Haiti and its recent struggles, it is sometimes difficult not to succumb to 
                hopelessness, to the feeling that nothing can be done.But in truth, none of what has happened in Haiti during the past 200 years has been inevitable. Haiti&rsquo;s current situation is the culmination of a long set of historical choices that date back to its beginning as a French plantation colony. And it is the consequence of the ways that powerful political leaders and institutions, inside and outside the country, have ignored and suppressed the aspirations of Haiti&rsquo;s majority.&rdquo;

Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
